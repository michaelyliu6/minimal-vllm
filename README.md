# minimal-vllm

A minimal implementation of an LLM inference engine inspired by vLLM, designed for educational purposes. This project aims to provide a simplified but functional version of a modern LLM inference engine to help developers understand the core concepts and implementation details of large language model serving.

## Project Goals

- Create a minimal but functional LLM inference engine
- Implement core features of modern LLM serving:
  - Efficient KV cache management
  - Continuous batching
  - Paged attention
  - Basic model loading and inference
- Provide clear, well-documented code that serves as a learning resource
- Focus on understanding the fundamental concepts rather than production-level optimization

## Key Concepts to Implement

1. **KV Cache Management**
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs
   - Memory management for cache entries
   - Cache eviction strategies

2. **Continuous Batching**
   - Dynamic batch size management
   - Request queuing and scheduling
   - Batch optimization

3. **Paged Attention**
   - Memory-efficient attention computation
   - Block-based memory management
   - Attention pattern optimization

4. **Model Serving**
   - Basic model loading and initialization
   - Inference pipeline
   - Simple API for model interaction

## Learning Resources

This project is designed to be educational. As you work through the implementation, you'll learn about:

- LLM inference optimization techniques
- Memory management for large language models
- Attention mechanism implementations
